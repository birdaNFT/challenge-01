 ## Description

  This is an example website for a social marketing company focusing on good seo and acessibility through semantic html and best practice naming conventions. The goals for this project was to refactor existing code for a companies website and optimising it to be more efficient, be easier to understand for other developers and improve on its accessibility.

  This project needed to use semantic html and alt attributes for better accessibility, and I had to reduce code where it was not needed. I also had to add comments to help other developers understand the code easily and what each css selectors was targeting. I chose to update class names to describe the content better to reduce the need for comments.

  The basis for the project involved pulling from a cloned GitLab repository to get the source files and creating a new repository hosted on GitHub, using GitHub Pages to deploy to. It also involved producing this comprehensive README file as a practice for future projects.
